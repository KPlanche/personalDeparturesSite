				<h4>Traveller/Co-Creator</h4>
				<h3>Scott Wilson</h3>
				<p>Scott’s passion for travel started very early in life. As a child he covered his bedroom walls in maps from National Geographic and would daydream what those places looked like.

Nominated for a <strong>Gemini Award</strong> for his work on <em>DEPARTURES</em>, Scott continues to share his travel experiences with enthusiastic audiences at speaking engagements and through hosting and producing new and upcoming programs.</p>
				<p>Scott and Andre have paired their mutual love of scuba diving with their passion for travel in the acclaimed adventure series <a href="http://descendingtv.com/"><em>DESCENDING</em></a> which airs on OLN in Canada and Travel Channel internationally.</p>
				<p>Scott continues to challenge himself personally as a producer, diver, motorcycle enthusiast and pilot.</p>
